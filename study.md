## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use the this variable to refer back to the object that contains the function
we use 'this' in.  It enables code to be less ambiguous so for example if in another
part of the file, we created another variable with the same name, the function won't
become confused as to which instance of the name we are referring to.
```

## This is what

In your own words give explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
As an english major, thanks to that javascript is sexy article I will now always
think of 'this' as the code version of a pronoun. So you use it within the same
sentence (or object) to refer to something that has already been referenced/defined.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype chain allows us to assign multiple levels of properties and methods
to an object.  That way if we want to relate a new object back to parameters or
properties we already defined, we can easily assign the new variable to the bottom
of the prototype chain.
```
